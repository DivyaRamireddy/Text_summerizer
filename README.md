# Text_summerizer
A simple Python text summarizer that extracts the most important sentences from a paragraph using word-frequency scoring. It splits text into sentences, calculates word importance, scores each sentence, and returns the top N lines. Fast, lightweight, and built using only Python’s built-in features.
